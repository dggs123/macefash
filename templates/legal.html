        <p>If, by any chance, you wish to <strong>have your picture taken down from this website</strong>, you can do the following:<p>
        <ol>
            <li>Access <a href="{{ url_for('login') }}">this page</a>.</li>
            <li>Log in with your Facebook account.</li>
            <li>The system will search the user database and allow you to set your profile as <strong>hidden</strong>. This means that your picture will not appear on the vote and top pages anymore.</li>
